#  Shell Mate

> Terminal command logger 

---

##  Features

> Logs every meaningful command  
> Includes timestamp + working directory  
> Ignores noisy commands like `ls`, `clear`, etc.  
> Auto-trims the log file if it gets too big  
> Use `showlog` from *anywhere* to view the logs  
> Simple installation, lightweight footprint

## Installation
(STEPS YET TO BE COMPLETED)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nandhra702/shell_mate.git
cd shell_mate
./install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

##  Test It Out

1. **Restart** your terminal  
2. Run a few shell commands (`cd`, `mkdir`, `nano`, etc.)  
3. Type `showlog` and check the command log!  
4. Verify `.bashrc` has this line:
   ```bash
   source ~/shell_mate/logger-trap.bash
   ```

##  Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] `zoxide`-like smart directory jumping (DONE SCENE)

##  Project Structure

```
shell_mate/
├── logger-trap.bash     # Core logic for logging
├── install.sh           # Sets up the environment
├── showlog              # Executable to view logs
├── .logger_config       # Stores filters, thresholds
└── logs/                # Where your history lives
```

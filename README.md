#  Shell Mate

> Terminal command logger 

---

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Logs every meaningful command  
âœ… Includes timestamp + working directory  
âœ… Ignores noisy commands like `ls`, `clear`, etc.  
âœ… Auto-trims the log file if it gets too big  
âœ… Use `showlog` from *anywhere* to view the logs  
âœ… Simple installation, lightweight footprint

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nandhra702/shell_mate.git
cd shell_mate
./install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Test It Out

1. **Restart** your terminal  
2. Run a few shell commands (`cd`, `mkdir`, `nano`, etc.)  
3. Type `showlog` and check the command log!  
4. Verify `.bashrc` has this line:
   ```bash
   source ~/shell_mate/logger-trap.bash
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] `zoxide`-like smart directory jumping

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
shell_mate/
â”œâ”€â”€ logger-trap.bash     # Core logic for logging
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh           # Sets up the environment
â”œâ”€â”€ showlog              # Executable to view logs
â”œâ”€â”€ .logger_config       # Stores filters, thresholds
â””â”€â”€ logs/                # Where your history lives
```
